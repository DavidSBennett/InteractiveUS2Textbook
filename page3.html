						<strong>The Military Advisory Group</strong></h1>
					<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">&nbsp;If you lived during the Vietnam War, your actual experience may have started all the way back in 1950, when you might have been assigned to Brigadier General Francis G. Brinkâ€™s Military Assistance Advisory Group, which was tasked with advising Vietnamese soldiers in conventional combat techniques developed since World War II. In many ways, this meant working hand in hand with many different Vietnamese citizens who spoke either French or Vietnamese and whose cultural expectations were significantly different then your own. However, by 1954 you would notice that the number of U.S. soldiers in the country had reached a peak, and your status would change subtly as French officers begin to abandon the region. You would become the only representative of western culture, and you would even see numerous private institutions, such as <a href="https://vietnamproject.archives.msu.edu/" class="text-primary">Michigan State University</a>,&nbsp;begin investing in South Vietnam.</p>

                    Below you will find the Gulf Of Tonkin Resolution. As stated before, the United States never formally declared war on North Vietnam. Instead, the United States took on the role of policing agent overseas. Given that it wasn't a formal declaration of war, the actual goal of the military action was left up to the President's discretion. As the document states, soldiers were tasked with promoting peace and security, but the orders they were given often translated into massive destructive tasks like firebombing entire villages and strips of forested land. As such, many South Vietnamese citizens saw the soldiers as unfriendly, which again works against the final goal of promoting peace and security in the region.</p>

            <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">As the graph above shows, the number of troops going to South Vietnam escalated very quickly after war was declared. Many of those new troops were part of an accelerated draft program aimed at ramping up U.S. troop numbers. At the beginning of the war, the draft targeted older men who were out of school and unmarried. This meant that many college age citizens began to either enroll in universities or actively enlist in the military to avoid the draft. Some citizens struggled with the decision, and I recommend reading Tim O'Brien's <em>The Things They Carried</em>&nbsp;as it illustrates Tim's particular struggles on the border of Canada as he debates following through with the draft of leaving the country never to come back again. One year after the declaration of the war, in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson ended the policy of "marriage deferment," meaning that draftees could not longer seek marriage to avoid being drafted. In 1971, Congress would further the draft ending the "student deferment," which let university students avoid the draft by being enrolled in higher education. The video below is Colonel Clark talking about the draft in 1968, and it illustrates the complicated relationship the military had with framing the draft for the public. On the one hand, many military personnel were proud of the volunteer nature of the military, but they also had their own individual quotas that they had to meet.&nbsp;<br></h5>

                <strong>The War Experience</strong></h4>
            <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">The soldierâ€™s experience in Vietnam was grueling, disorienting, and often terrifying. The war experience in Vietnam often included guerrilla conflicts fought in dense jungles, where American troops faced an elusive enemy, unpredictable ambushes, and booby traps like punji pits and tripwires. Because the war was fought over ideology, it became difficult for soldiers to determine who was the enemy. The Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army blended into the civilian population, making it difficult for U.S. forces to distinguish friend from foe, adding to the psychological strain. Even the environment was an enemy, as intense heat, monsoon rains, and thick vegetation made it difficult to navigate the already unfamiliar terrain. Morale suffered extensively as victories were often measured in body counts rather than territorial gains, which devalued the soldierâ€™s overall sacrifice and made the warâ€™s victory seem impossible. This ultimately led some troops to question the purpose of their mission, especially as the war dragged on without a clear end in sight. The best evidence I can provide of this experience is this footage taken in 1970 by CBS Evening News crews as the platoon comes under fire and the soldiers are shot at, one is wounded, and ultimately, he was evacuated.&nbsp;</h5>

His experiences detail not just the chaos he experienced during the war, but the nature of his return as a wounded soldier and the purple heart he was offered. He struggled with recognizing his survival as a truly heroic act, and this ultimately demonstrates the complicated relationship soldiers had returning home. While both liberal and conservative politicians promoted stances defending veterans, they found themselves at odds as to which other services would be cut to reallocated funds to help back the GI Bill's promises.&nbsp;<br></p>

						One of the more difficult parts of understanding the soldier's returning home experience is trying separate the politics of the era from the real lived experiences on the ground. For instance, on July 20, 1987 Chicago Tribune columnist wrote a controversial editorial interrogating whether or not soldiers who fought in Vietnam were "spit upon" when they came home. In many ways, it became a lightning rod for cultural politics, as individuals who did not serve in the war came to defense of the returned soldier's experience. He claims that he was inundated with letters from all across the nation describing events of horror targeting returning soldiers, and so he wrote the book <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=34RuAAAAMAAJ&q=home-coming+soldiers+vietnam+war&dq=home-coming+soldiers+vietnam+war&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&printsec=frontcover&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0oIe3qbWMAxX0RjABHf_8H6gQ6AF6BAgFEAM" class="text-primary">Home-Coming: When the Soldiers Returned From Vietnam</a>&nbsp;republishing 81 of those letters.&nbsp;However, he writes that it was difficult to validate the authenticity of each letter, and so he only included those letters that he felt were accurate. Since then, historians have criticized him for this approach. Jerry Lembcke would even go on to write the book <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrzaNOjjzwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+spitting+image&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiiwO6_qbWMAxUYSzABHUxFD9wQ6AF6BAgEEAM" class="text-primary">The Spitting Image: Myth, Memory and the Legacy of Vietnam</a> that restructures the image of the soldier being spat upon as a myth.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
                
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">As historians, we should recognize the truth must exist somewhere in between. This entire subsections explores the complicated relationship soldiers before, during and after the Vietnam War. You've explored a number of primary sources, including the resolution that ramped up the military conflict along with various clips illustrating the complicated relationship soldiers had with the demands they faced. When soldiers first entered conflict, the actual victory conditions of the Vietnam war were complicated and confusing. That confusion became even more difficult as time went on, as citizens both in South Vietnam and the United States struggled to understand the soldier's purpose. When it became clear that the war was not achieving any of the goals politicians had set out, public sentiment began to decline steeply and interpret the war as a failure. While individual humans dislike with failure, entire nations can buckle under the pressure of their collective failure. While it might be informative to find out there was an overall pattern of violence targeting Vietnam veterans when they came home, the truth is that the evidence is far too murky to prove. What we do know, is that many Vietnam veterans felt abandoned by the entire nation as a whole when they returned home struggling with PTSD, drug addiction, and a growing level of poverty that was the result of the struggling labor market. As Mark Boulton writes in his book <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=fK0TBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Failing+our+veterans+:+the+G.I.+Bill+and+the+Vietnam+Generation+quotes&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjR_tjIp7WMAxUMSTABHRalIwMQ6AF6BAgHEAM" class="text-primary">Failing our Veterans: The GI Bill and the Vietnam Generation</a>, "political compromises made at the highest levels of government set the stage for the problems faced by Vietnam veterans when it came to claim what they thought was owed to them." Given that broader framework, trying to isolate individual harms targeting individual veterans within our communities becomes far less important as the larger patterns of fiscal, political, and social abandonment veterans felt made them far more vulnerable.<br></p>
