					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">American involvement in the Vietnam War began as part of the United States government's use of the containment policy toward Communism as discussed previously. At first, the U.S. only supported France’s fight against the communist Viet Minh but, after France’s defeat in 1954, the U.S. became the primary western power in the region helping to establish South Vietnam under president Ngo Dinh Diem. Despite American aid, South Vietnam struggled against communist insurgents, and Diem’s unpopular leadership led to his assassination in 1963.<br><br>In 1964, the USS Maddox was fire upon in the Gulf of Tonkin, which resulted in President Johnson being granted the tower to escalate military support in the region. By 1965, American troops were fully engaged in combat, and more importantly victory was vague and undefined. Under General Westmoreland, the war focused on body counts rather than territorial gains, but despite increasing troop numbers and heavy bombing, victory remained elusive. By 1968, with over 500,000 U.S. troops deployed and mounting casualties, public protests erupted, fueling the American counterculture movement.<br><br>Document Citation: Joint Resolution for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security in Southeast Asia, also known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, August 10, 1964.

                <strong>Tragedy in Vietnam</strong><br></h4>
            <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">As your textbook argues, the Vietnam War "contributed more to public disillusionment" with the U.S. government then any other issue. There were at least three distinct points that set the war in opposition to public sentiment. First, the U.S. policy allowing college students to defer the draft by being enrolled before 1971 meant that for the first time, wealthier citizens could actively choose not to participate in the war by enrolling in their local universities. This also meant that professors struggled with failing students, as failure in a class could literally lead to the student being forced into the army and fighting overseas. <br><br>Secondly, the Vietnam War had a vastly different relationship to the growing media industry then previous wars. As we saw in World War II, so much of the information about the war was influenced heavily by the government. As far as the Vietnam War goes, the government struggled with both shaping the overall narrative of the war, but also in containing various failures within the war. The war was the first to be extensively televised, exposing the brutality of the conflict and creating a "credibility gap" between government claims of success and the grim reality on the ground. There are several examples of this, like the 1968 Tet Offensive, which for the first saw the broadcasting of the execution of a Vietnamese general. <br><br>The third distinction that sets the Vietnam War apart from previous wars, was the U.S. citizenry's failure to grapple the moral nature of the war. In World War II, and even to some degree the Korean War, our role seemed to be crystal clear as media outlets framed our enemies as the clear enemies in the conflict all the while censoring our own failures. During the Vietnam War, media outlets were far more dynamic and the narrative was far less clear. U.S. soldiers openly discussed their own reservations with the war, and more importantly they did so through a TV camera that recorded everything succinctly. One of the best examples of this comes in the early part of the war, when Morley Safer actively filmed the burning of Cam Ne on August 3, 1965. I want you to think about this footage and what it meant for the individuals involved.&nbsp;<div>

            <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">Amid growing unrest, President Johnson chose not to seek reelection in 1968. In stead, the Democratic Party ran Hubert Humphrey, a representative aimed at unifying a number of voices from more diverse communities within the Democratic Party. By 1968, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ckAAOv8WQo" class="text-primary">Walter Cronkite struggled to described the war on air</a>, ultimately concluding that it can only be explained as being "mired in a stalemate." In the end though, Richard Nixon won the presidency with a narrow majority, using what historians describe as the "southern strategy," which saw North Carolina (For the first time since 1928) and South Carolina (for the second time since 1876) vote Republican. Once in office, Nixon's policy of "Vietnamization" aimed to shift responsibility to South Vietnamese forces while secretly escalating attacks in Laos and Cambodia. These actions, once revealed, sparked renewed protests, including the fatal shootings of students at Kent State and Jackson State. <br><br>But as with previous presidents, Nixon failed to define what victory meant in Vietnam. By 1970, Nixon went on air declaring his intention to achieve <a href="https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/peace-with-honor/" class="text-primary">"peace with honor" in the region</a>. These negotiations were lengthy, wrought with conflict, and tense, and only resulted in the signing of the Paris Peace Accords by 1973. Peace however was still not viable, as U.S. soldiers would only truly evacuate the region in 1975. This following footage illustrates clearly the nature of the retreat, and it complicates Nixon's attempt to shape the narrative.</h5>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">There are many ways to explore the war itself. Your goal here is to make a decision. You may be interested in how economic conditions in the United States led to the shaping of the military. Not only were many of the soldiers interested in becoming economic leaders back home, but they also would help promote economic capitalism in a region that was largely resistant to those ideas. However, you may also be interested in understanding more about the Cold War, which would ultimately mean exploring the political history of the Vietnam War. Finally, you may also choose to explore the social perspective, which is best reflected in the students who flooded the streets for years in protest to the war.</p>
